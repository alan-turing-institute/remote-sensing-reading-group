# Code of Conduct for the Remote Sensing Reading Group

As a community-oriented reading group, we welcome everyone and encourage a 
friendly and positive environment.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behaviour within 
the community, across all platforms including this repository, Slack, Zoom, and 
any other mediums where members communicate. We are committed to providing a 
welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be 
honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the 
community.

Our open source community endeavours to:

- **Be friendly and patient.**

- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports 
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited 
  to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, 
  immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual 
  orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, 
  political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by others, and you, in turn, will 
  depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and 
  colleagues, and you should consider those consequences when making decisions. 
  Remember that we're a worldwide community; thus, you might not be communicating 
  in someone else's primary language.

- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is 
  no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some 
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a 
  personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel 
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

- **Choose our words carefully**: We are a community of 
  professionals and conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do 
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary 
  behaviour are not acceptable.

- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and 
  technical, happen all the time, and it is important that we resolve 
  disagreements and differing views constructively.

This code of conduct will be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it remains 
relevant and effective. Suggestions for changes are welcomed and should be 
raised by creating a GitHub issue or by directly reaching out to the organisers.

If you are unsure about the rules or what is acceptable, seek advice and 
guidance from the organisers, who are here to help.

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all.
Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally
as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take
responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility
to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

While not all the aspects listed below are legally protected characteristics,
we value and respect everyone's unique identities and experiences. Although this 
list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender
identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political
beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, 
and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the 
protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, 
please report it by contacting Turing HR at [hr@turing.ac.uk](mailto:hr@turing.ac.uk) and, if you 
feel comfortable doing so, the reading group organisers and maintainers: 
[Thijs van der Plas](mailto:vanderplas@turing.ac.uk) and [Varun Chhabra](mailto:vchhabra@turing.ac.uk), or alternatively [Cassandra Gould van Praag](cgouldvanpraag@turing.ac.uk) as external contact who is not involved in the group.

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information, if you feel comfortable doing so. Otherwise, feel free to do so anonymously.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. 
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.
