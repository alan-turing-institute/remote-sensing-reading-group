# The Remote Sensing Reading Group

Public repo for The Alan Turing Institute's reading group on Remote Sensing data and analysis.

If you're based at the Turing, follow `#remote-sensing` on the Turing Slack for the most recent updates.

**To see all the slides and reading materials for previous sessions, see the [archive](PREVIOUS.md).**


## Overview

The group meets <b>every other week on Thursdays at 11-12</b> (odd-numbered weeks). Everyone is welcome to join! If you have any questions email [Thijs](mailto:t.vanderplas@turing.ac.uk) or [Varun](mailto:vchhabra@turing.ac.uk). As a Turing-organised event, we expect everyone to follow the [Turing code of conduct](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/policies-and-guidelines), and we also ask everyone to go through our reading group [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md).
