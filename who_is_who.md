# Remote Sensing reading group - Who is who?

**Name:** Anna Zanchetta

- **About Me:** My background is in Physics of the Atmosphere and Remote sensing, with applications to environmental studies (water management and desertification), spatial inequalities and sustainable transport. I am interested in anything maps and open source.
As a Turing Research Fellow, I am currenlty working on ML and Computer vision for buildings footprints detection in collaboration with HOT (Humanitarian Openstreetmap Team, see [repo](https://github.com/ciupava/fAIr-utilities)).


**Name:** Natalia Efremova

- **About me** 
Senior Research Fellow for Environment and Sustainability. 50% Alan Turing, 50% Queen Mary University. Background: computer science, computer vision. Interested in: applications of satellite imagery for sustainable agriculture. 
In ATI, I'm currently working in [DeepSensor](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/deepsensor) project and PV forecasting project. Mostly working with Sentinel-2 and Planet imagery. Staring to work on the [EUMETSAT](https://www.eumetsat.int) imagery. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=7SpjSG4AAAAJ&hl=en)

**Name:** John Francis

- **About Me:** I am a Data Scientist in the Public Policy Programme. My background is in political science and geography. The majority of my work is around LLM applications in government, but I have one Turing project ongoing that involves mapping trees from [aerial imagery](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/satellite-and-aerial-imagery-government). I primarily work with OS imagery, Sentinel-2 data, and LiDAR point cloud data. Besides trees, i am very interested in the different ways image embeddings can be used to learn things about the built and natural environment.

**Name:** [Thijs van der Plas](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/dr-thijs-van-der-plas)

- **About me:** I am a Research Associate in the Environment & Sustainability programme. In my project, we work on integrating remote sensing data with (scarce) field observations of wildlife to map biodiversity at high resolution and precision. Before this, I worked with the Peak District NP to [map land cover](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/impact/mapping-habitats-peak-district-national-park) at very high resolution. I work with optical remote sensing data (multispectral satellite imagery and aerial photography), computer vision methods and self-supervised/unsupervised methods to reduce annotation requirements.

**Name:** [Isabel Fenton](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/isabel-fenton) 

- **About me:** I am a Research Data Scientist in the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group) at the Turing. I am currently the main software developer for the [scivision](https://sci.vision/) project. I have been working on developing the [pixelflow tool](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/pixelflow) (for extracting information about the characteristics of objects in images), with a particular focus on remote sensing data. Prior to joining the Turing, I worked in palaeontology studying the influence of past climate change on species distributions. 

**Name:** [Barbara Metzler](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/barbara-metzler)

- **About me:** I am a Research Associate with the [Science of Cities and Regions group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/science-cities-and-regions) and currently working on the [Demoland project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/demoland). As part of my research, I'm leveraging foundational models and Sentinel-2 images to make predictions on environmental and social inequalities across England. During my PhD, I used unsupervised/self-supervised deep learning methods together with high-resolutions satellite images (0.3m/px) to classify urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa.
